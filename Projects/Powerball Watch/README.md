# Powerball Watch
This is an app I started prototyping a couple of years ago.  Currently, what it does is pull the Powerball results from the State of New York government open data portal.  The code is written in Objective-C.  Originally I had other intentions for this app, but I have since started a fresh Swift project for that.
